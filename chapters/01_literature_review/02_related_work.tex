\section{Related Work and Research Questions}
\label{sec:related-work}
This section reviews specific prior research directly relevant to our current endeavor. Many attempts have been made to unify gravity with quantum mechanics, each with its own set of challenges and successes \citep{Bloggs2021}.

This dissertation aims to answer the following primary research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can quantum gravity be formulated in a way that is consistent with both general relativity and quantum mechanics?
    \item What are the observable consequences of a unified theory at accessible energy scales?
    \item Can a complete \gls{guten} provide new insights into dark matter and dark energy?
\end{enumerate}
Our documentation and analysis are meticulously prepared using \gls{latex}, ensuring precision and clarity.
