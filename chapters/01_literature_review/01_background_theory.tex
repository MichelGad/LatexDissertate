\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}
The Standard Model of particle physics has been incredibly successful in describing three of the four fundamental forces: the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. However, gravity remains an outlier, resisting attempts to integrate it seamlessly into the quantum field theory framework. Pioneering work by \citet{Doe2022} and others has laid the groundwork for many of the concepts explored herein.

A cornerstone of modern physics is the mass-energy equivalence, expressed as:
\[ E = mc^2 \]
where \(E\) represents energy, \(m\) denotes mass, and \(c\) is the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation highlights the profound connection between mass and energy. Another fundamental principle is Gauss's law for electricity, which describes the distribution of electric fields:
\[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \]
Here, \(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field, \(\rho\) is the charge density, and \(\varepsilon_0\) is the vacuum permittivity. Our work builds upon these foundational principles.
