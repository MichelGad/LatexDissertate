\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}
The results obtained from our theoretical calculations and simulations are presented in this chapter. We demonstrate the emergence of a consistent gravitational interaction from a gauge theory perspective and identify a novel mechanism for mass generation within the unified framework. The predicted particle spectrum is discussed, along with a comparison to existing experimental data from particle accelerators. Furthermore, we present preliminary findings on the cosmological implications of our model, including its potential to explain dark matter properties.
