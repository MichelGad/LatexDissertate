\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}
In this chapter, we discuss the implications of our results in the broader context of theoretical physics. We critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of our proposed model, contrasting it with other prominent approaches to quantum gravity and grand unification. The consistency of our findings with current experimental observations is assessed, and areas where future experimental verification would be most beneficial are highlighted. We also address potential challenges and future research directions stemming from this work.
