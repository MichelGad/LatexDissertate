\label{chap:methodology}
This chapter details the theoretical and computational methodologies employed in this dissertation. We utilize a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations to explore the properties of various unified field theories. Our approach involves extending established frameworks by incorporating new symmetry principles and investigating their implications for particle spectra and cosmological phenomena. Specific attention is given to quantum field theory in curved spacetime and the renormalization group flow of gravity.
