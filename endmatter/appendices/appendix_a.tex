\chapter{Supplementary Data and Derivations}
\label{chap:appendix-a}
This appendix provides supplementary data, detailed mathematical derivations, and additional figures that support the main arguments presented in the dissertation. Here, you will find the full set of field equations, renormalization group equations, and Feynman diagrams used in our calculations. Specific examples of numerical simulation parameters and convergence plots are also included.
